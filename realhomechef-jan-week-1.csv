1/30/20 21:43,"Instacart customer rep told me that they don't share paper receipts with their customers, so we can't see the real in-store prices hey, doesn't matter, I don't need paper receipt I went directly to the stores website &amp; checked in-store prices myself &amp; compared them WOW"
1/30/20 21:43,"God bless him. Amazon, Instacart, etc. are this century's version of the milkman. "
1/30/20 21:42,"Careful, walmart is usually doordash and unfortunately according to trust pilot their service is just as awful. Find a small scale delivery option instead! Sorry that happened!"
1/30/20 21:41,"1) Buy a month’s supply of groceries, including tips for the Instacart drivers. 2) Buy a car today. Not a great car, but one that would get me to the store/work/appointments/see friends/activities for my kid. 3) Buy a better car and have the payment and insurance covered."
1/30/20 21:37,"Today in weird Instacart substitution suggestions, instead of a chocolate bar, a bag of lettuce. Instead of acetaminophen, avocado, eggs, frozen peas or a pineapple."
1/30/20 21:33, . That isn’t my fault. Don’t work for instacart then. I do ask if they want a bottle of water while they are unloading. They allows decline. Such dedicated folks.
1/30/20 21:31,I am too scared to have groceries delivered after instacart charged my card $400 Multiple times when I hadn’t even ordered anything to begin with. 
1/30/20 21:24,ok. trying out @Instacart since I am home working with a sick kid. wish me luck. Need that chicken soup! #modernmotherhood
1/30/20 21:21,Instacart doesn't pay enough to haul all that for you... 
1/30/20 21:18,"People who deliver for gig economy apps (Postmates, Door Dash, Instacart, etc) are just as reliant on tips as the servers at a restaurant. Maybe more reliant...fewer “tables” and they have vehicle overhead. So you better fucking tip well. If not, don’t use the service at all. "
1/30/20 21:18,And once again Sasha is lying out her ass. Instacart sets prices and keeps profits. Customers need to demand they get thier STORE receipts
1/30/20 21:17,Can’t pay rent or feed families Pretty much describes 10s of thousands of Uber/Lyft/ Instacart workers that are being exploited by their employers? Or do you buy the argument Uber is fighting for flexibility? Give the 5 dollars a hour and freedom or just wanting to screw them?
1/30/20 21:16,"Instacart a complete scam, since they exploited thier shoppers down to starvation wages, they are now targeting thier own customers, they just added two more fees too "
1/30/20 21:16,"..I don't see how Instacart can justify that they care about helping people &amp; familes when they are charging so much money on top of the regular in store prices, how did paying $80 extra for my groceries help me &amp; my grand daughter? Hmm..? "

1/30/20 19:57,Will the instacart delivery that includes a new bottle of ketchup get to my office before the grubhub delivery that contains my fries arrives?

1/30/20 16:30,Why is #Instacart fighting so hard to keep its drivers from joining together in union? Maybe it's because drivers are started to get organized in an effort to fight Instacart's exploitative practices.

1/30/20 16:19,Check out Instacart: 1 hour grocery delivery! Here's $10 worth of free groceries: 
1/30/20 16:16,No @Instacart I am not. The Big Game was in November and @CalFootball got the Axe.
1/30/20 16:15,"We had $15 off which was great, saved the day, but the driver got lost for 10 minutes and showed up with all the plastic bags. Not sure what the options can be, but I hope there are some."
1/30/20 16:15,
1/30/20 16:12,"Paul, I feel like you should cut your losses and just be happy that your instacart shopper isn't bright enough to remember your actual address. She would probably pee on your welcome mat or something. Give @dumplingUS a try. Better service and no one will pee on your mat."
1/30/20 16:11,Yup that’s definitely stealing which doesn’t surprise me at all because they’ve also been known to steal tips from their workers! Instacart is a very unethical company.
1/30/20 16:11,I deliver for Shipt but shopping thru instacart lmao
1/30/20 16:10,"Yes, I think that is one of those sketchy ways that Instacart makes extra money without it being obvious. I am getting ready to put up a tweet outlining a little more about Dumpling and that is one of the ways they are superior. You pay for exactly what you get. Store prices."
1/30/20 16:09,ummmm cool @Instacart 
1/30/20 16:03,"We had to do the same thing in December. Sickness in the house and $20 off. Our driver came with the paper bags form the grocery store, not specific instacart bags."

1/30/20 15:37,"My instacart shopper is so nice Anyway, use my code for $10 on your first order "
1/30/20 15:37,"Well, I did get gassy, if that's any consolation. Yeah, Haven't heard anything, so sent an email instead. It might also be a Lablaws issue, so I reached out to them as well."

1/30/20 15:35,"Thanks so much. I hadn't heard of this company. Will have to see if it's in our area. Yes-it's a huge risk to let a stranger in (to see our layout, kids, etc.) so I avoid it if at all possible (which for me it usually is)."

1/28/20 19:51,"I had one item (raspberries) missing from my order and my pork loin was 26 days expired. First off, a store should not be selling that on their shelves and those picking the groceries should be doing a better job at looking at the expiration date."

1/28/20 19:31,"Where is that stated on the app? I know that for some it’s below the logo (see Target below), but is it anywhere else? The store I shopped at (Also below) says “everyday store prices,” which indicates to me that it should be the same as in store. Maybe I missed it, though!"

1/28/20 19:20,Instacart prices are diffrent then the in store prices. It even says so on the app that the prices on the app may be higher than in store. That’s how they make their money.

1/28/20 3:36,
1/28/20 3:35,So a Teamster who decided to work for instacart decided that shoppers should unionize &amp; create an app to unionize. That sounds like Nicole and Ivan from rideshare drivers United. Is it just me or is there a pattern forming? @DinoManelli
1/28/20 3:27,Wow. @Instacart seems nice.

1/28/20 2:54,"Also if you think the customer not tipping is them looking for charity but that the companies not paying well enough is not the companies looking for charity, then you're just obviously biased here."
1/28/20 2:54,I wonder if InstaCart will deliver me two cans
1/28/20 2:52,The company just didn't take into account all the costs involved in providing their service to me and that's the management's incompetence.
1/28/20 2:51,"Using instacart is the issue. Your shopper is making $7 to shop and deliver that order and you are going to get what instacart pays for. See if you can find a @dumplingUS shopper in your area. You get to pick your shopper and get to know them. Better service, better prices."
1/28/20 2:49,"A gig worker is a service provider too. They provide human hours. That the company has to pay for. And after paying for everyone, if the company cannot make the economics work, it's not the problem of the service providers. /n"

1/28/20 1:04,This is the take. Upper management talked to these organizing folks like they don't have other options. All of them do and told them as much. They do Instacart because they choose to. Not all are so lucky They are fierce and cutting through the corporate bullshit with ease.
